# tablero

Tablero is a dashboard heavily inspired by `spatie/laravel-dashboard` but written in Golang, the main motivation behind this repository is how cumbersome I found the requirement of deploying a full scale laravel application just to have a dashboard.

## Tech stack
- Golang
- Svelte (SvelteKit)
- Sqlite (embedded database)
- SSE

## Features

1. Grid control.
2. Dynamic information with SSE.
3. Several display tiles.
4. Extensible.
